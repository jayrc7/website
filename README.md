# website
Personal Website developed with ReactJS and some BootStrap 4, hosted on github pages and can be found at <a href = "https://jasonrcabrera.com"> jasonrcabrera.com </a>

As terrible as my former website seems, I enjoy looking back because it shows how much I've grown in designing and programming. 

Source code is found in the master branch. Built static branch is found in the gh-pages branch.

Will look into Firebase in the future.
